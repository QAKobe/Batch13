    Facebook INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

    1-What is object? And tell me about a few methods of it?
    **Object is a presentation of the class(blueprint)
    **There are many methods of object, but we focus on these:
        1-.equals --> which is comparison
        2-toString --> it shows all the variables in a String form.
        3-Hashcode --> location of the element(object)
    2-What is the difference between object and class?
    **Object and Class:
        Class is blueprint/templates which you can create as many as objects you like
        Object is a member of instance of a class.
        Class --> one class can have one scenario
        Object --> you can create as many as object you want.
        Class --> is declared with class keyword
        Object --> is the all child of class
    3-How do you initialize your instance variables?
        There are different ways to initialize instance variables
        -->Constructor
        -->Methods(getters and setters)specifically setters
        -->directly assign the value(by passing)
        -->creating an object and call it.
    4-What is the difference between instance and local variables?
        Instance variables:                         Local Variables:
          ->belong to the class                   -> belong to block of the code(method)
          ->it has default values(null,0,0.0)     -> it doesn't have default values
          -> can have access modifiers            -> cannot have access modifiers
     */
