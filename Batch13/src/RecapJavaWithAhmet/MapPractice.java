    POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESIONS:

    1-Can you tell me about map and how do you use map in your project?
        *Map is an awesome interface that I used in my project to store my data as KEY-VALUE
        pairs.


    2-What is connection between Map and Collection?
        *They are all useful for project for different purposes.
        *As mentioned earlier, Set is all about uniqueness, list about duplication,
        and efficiency. Map is all about key-value pairs.
        Show off NOTES:
                        Hey Madam/Sir, as you know, KEY part of the map must be UNIQUE, and VALUE part can be duplicate
                        ********So, based on this I can say that MAP IS A COMBINATION OF LIST AND SET***
                        LIST-->REFERS TO VALUE*****SET-->REFERS TO KEY*******

    3-What are the types of Maps and difference between them?
        ORDERS BASED ON KEYS --> Ahmet=2, mehmet=3, burak=3;
    --> HashMap      --> it store elements randomly no order
    -->LinkedHashMap --> insertion order is kept(the way you assign)
    -->TreeMap       --> it stores the elements in ascending order

    4-What is Synchronization? Can you give an example?

    *Synchronization--> it executes any action one by one(one after another)
        -->We have two most common synchronized concept --> HASHTABLE, -->STRING BUFFER
        **Synchronized system is **THREAD-SAFE** and **SLOW**
        non-synchronized is system is not ***NOT THREAD SAFE*** but it is ***FAST***
        **Great example for non-synchronized is MAP!!!

    NOTE: ==> FIRST COME FIRST SERVE --> THREAD-SAFE

        HOMEWORK:
                String[] fruits = {"Apple", "Banana", "Peach", "Apple", "Orange", "Strawberry", "Banana", "Apple", "Cherry", "Orange"}

                Task is: Get the output of total items --
                OUTPUT: Apple =3, Banana =2, Peach = 1, Orange = 2, Strawberry = 1

                // TIP: you can use containsKey from map.
