    /*
    1-Constructor what is it? And what do you do with it? (What is the purpose of it?)
        *Constructor is a way to initialize instance variables.
        **Constructor assign the values directly to the objects features.

    2-Can you tell me the difference between constructor and method?
       *Constructor:                                           Method
       1-does not have return type                          1-must have return type
       2_must have same name of the class                   2-may or may not have same name of the class

    3-Can you make the constructor static, private or final?
         You cannot make the constructor static or final. But, as you know I am special tester that use different ways to improve my
         framework. That's why I can make the constructor private by using Singleton Pattern Design in my automation
         WHY are you making your constructor private in your Singleton?
                -I make my constructor private because I don't want anyone to change to initialize my driver
                 from that class.

    4-What is the difference between this, this(), super, super()?

    this --> this refers to instance variables and METHODS.
    this()--> this refers to constructor from same class ** IT MUST BE ON THE FIRST LINE OF THE CODES!!!!

    super--> refers to parent instance variables and methods()
    super()--> refers to parent constructor ** IT MUST BE ON THE FIRST LINE OF CODE!!!
